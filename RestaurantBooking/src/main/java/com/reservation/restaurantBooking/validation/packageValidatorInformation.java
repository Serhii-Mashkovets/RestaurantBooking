/**
 *
 * In a Java program using the Spring framework, a validator class is used to validate user input
 * and ensure that it adheres to a set of rules and constraints. This can help prevent errors, bugs,
 * and security vulnerabilities that may arise from incorrect data entry.
 *
 * A validator class can be used to check if a user has entered a valid email address,
 * phone number, or any other type of data that needs to be validated.
 * This can help improve the overall user experience and reduce the likelihood of data loss or corruption.
 *
 * Using a validator class can also help make your code more maintainable and scalable.
 * By separating the validation logic into a separate class, you can easily modify or add new validation rules
 * without having to modify the main application code.
 *
 * Another advantage of using a validator class is that it can help improve the overall performance of your application.
 * By validating user input before it is processed, you can reduce the amount of processing power needed
 * and improve the response time of your application.
