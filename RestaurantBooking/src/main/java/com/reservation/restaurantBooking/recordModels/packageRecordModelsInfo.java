/**
 *
 * Contains API models (DTOs) definitions.
 *
 * DTOs are objects that are used to transfer data between different parts of an application,
 * usually between a client and a server, or between different services.
 * DTOs model the data that is transferred between these parts of the application,
 * so their descriptions are usually in separate packages (or directories) to keep them separate from the rest of the application.
 * DTO model descriptions typically contain fields that represent the data that is being passed,
 * as well as possible methods for accessing that data.
